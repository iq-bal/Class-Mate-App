### GraphQL Integration
Uses the quiz system GraphQL mutations as documented in `quiz_docs.md`:

```graphql
mutation CreateQuiz($input: CreateQuizInput!) {
  createQuiz(input: $input) {
    id
    testTitle
    questions {
      id
      question
      options { A B C D }
      answer
    }
    duration
    total_marks
    is_active
    created_at
  }
}
```

### Question Generator API
Communicates with the external question generator service:

```http
POST /generate-questions-public
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

- file: PDF file
- num_questions: Number of questions
- difficulty: Difficulty level
- test_title: Quiz title
```

### State Management
Uses `ValueNotifier` for reactive state management:

```dart
enum QuizState {
  initial,           // Starting state
  loading,           // Generating questions or creating quiz
  questionsGenerated,// Questions ready for review
  quizCreated,       // Quiz successfully created
  error,             // Error occurred
}
```

## Error Handling

- Clear error messages when service is unavailable
- Instructions for starting the service

### PDF Processing Errors
- File type validation (PDF only)
- Content extraction error handling
- User-friendly error messages

### Quiz Creation Errors
- Course selection validation
- Form validation for all required fields
- GraphQL error handling and display

## Navigation Integration

The Quiz feature is integrated into the teacher navigation:

```dart
// Added to main_layout.dart for teachers
_navItems = [
  BottomNavItem(icon: Icons.dashboard, label: 'Dashboard'),
  BottomNavItem(icon: Icons.folder, label: 'Drive'),
  BottomNavItem(icon: Icons.quiz, label: 'Quiz'),        // New
  BottomNavItem(icon: Icons.person, label: 'Profile'),
];
```
